# Second Year Game Development Journey üéÆ

Welcome to my second year at university! This collection represents a year of passionate learning, creative problem-solving, and resilience in game development. Each project tells a story of growth, technical challenges overcome, and the joy of bringing ideas to life through code.

## üåü Project Highlights

### üèÅ **Cars Racing Game** - *Unity 3D Racing Excellence*
A fully-featured 3D racing experience that combines realistic physics with competitive AI opponents. This project showcases my growing mastery of Unity's physics systems and AI pathfinding.

**What makes it special:**
- **Realistic Car Physics**: Implemented wheel colliders and suspension systems for authentic driving feel
- **Smart AI Opponents**: Waypoint-based navigation with dynamic collision avoidance
- **Complete Racing Framework**: Checkpoints, lap tracking, leaderboards, and multiple camera perspectives
- **Player Experience Focus**: Collectible items, track progression, and intuitive controls

*Technical highlight: The AI system intelligently navigates racing lines while avoiding obstacles - watching the AI cars race feels genuinely competitive!*

### üè∞ **Forbidden Forest** - *First-Person Horror Adventure*
An atmospheric horror-puzzle game following Arthur's escape from medieval imprisonment. This ambitious project demonstrates storytelling through gameplay and complex system integration.

**Core achievements:**
- **Immersive Combat System**: Dual weapon mechanics with both magical spells and melee combat
- **Rich Quest Framework**: Multi-layered objectives with environmental storytelling
- **Advanced AI Behaviors**: Guard patrol systems with state machines and dynamic dialogue
- **Atmospheric Design**: Lighting systems and audio management creating genuine tension

*Personal pride: The spell casting system where players must stand still to cast creates genuine tactical decisions in combat!*

### ‚öîÔ∏è **RPG Game Friday** - *Solo Development Under Pressure*
Originally a 4-person university group project, this turn-based RPG became a testament to determination when team members from Ukraine couldn't continue due to the war. I completed this comprehensive RPG system entirely solo.

**Delivered systems:**
- **Complete Turn-Based Combat**: Magic system, equipment, damage calculations, and battle flow
- **Character Progression**: Experience, leveling, stat growth, and equipment management
- **World Building**: Area transitions, quest tracking, dialog system, and save/load functionality
- **Polished Experience**: Shop systems, inventory management, and audio integration

*Most meaningful moment: Realizing I could complete what was planned for four people taught me that passion and persistence can overcome any obstacle.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Growth & Skills Developed

**Programming Excellence:**
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular systems using interfaces, singletons, and separation of concerns
- **Advanced Unity Features**: Physics simulation, NavMesh AI, audio management, and UI systems
- **Problem-Solving**: From implementing realistic car physics to creating engaging spell combat

**Project Management:**
- **Solo Development**: Successfully completed a group project independently under challenging circumstances
- **Feature Integration**: Combined multiple complex systems into cohesive gaming experiences
- **Quality Focus**: Maintained code standards and user experience even under pressure

**Game Design Wisdom:**
- **Player Experience**: Understanding how technical systems translate to player enjoyment
- **System Balance**: Creating meaningful choices in combat, progression, and exploration
- **Atmospheric Creation**: Using lighting, audio, and pacing to create emotional engagement

## üíù What These Projects Mean to Me

Each project represents more than just code - they're milestones in understanding what makes games truly engaging. The racing game taught me the satisfaction of smooth, responsive controls. The horror game showed me how atmosphere and tension can be crafted through careful system design. The RPG project proved that determination and technical skill can overcome any challenge.

These aren't just portfolio pieces; they're proof that with creativity, persistence, and genuine care for the player experience, individual developers can create something truly special.

## üöÄ Looking Forward

This second year has been transformative - from learning Unity basics to implementing complex AI systems, from working in teams to managing entire projects solo. Each challenge faced and overcome has built not just technical skills, but confidence in tackling any development challenge ahead.

For fellow developers exploring these projects: I hope you find inspiration in the code, techniques that help your own projects, and perhaps most importantly, evidence that passionate development work can overcome any obstacle.
